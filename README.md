# profilegenerator

In this assignment I created a terminal based pdf generator that takes details from a user's Github profile and converts the data into a pdf resume. The user selects color theme from a list of several choices and enters their user name. All the other details are pulled from an axios request to the github api. The data is processed as html/css and then converted into a pdf file by the node module html-pdf.

Run "npm install" in the command line to create modules
